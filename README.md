# CASL Benchmark on Serpent
Serpent cases following the CASL VERA Core Physics benchmark progression problem specification (see inside doc/).

There is no big reason at the moment behind this besides personal study. I also wanted to extract a few images for teaching purposes, which is why there is a cylindrical pin cell case that is not supposed to run, just to plot.
